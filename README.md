# HAL

The purpose of this repository is experimentation with Chat and RAG techniques.

Various examples and experiments can be found in `cookbooks/`.

## What I think I want in a personal Chat + RAG system:

- All models, embeddings, and vectors run locally.
- All data is stored locally.
- Indexed data is cached.
- User-definable document collections with configurable parameters (like chunking).
- Conversations are stored and indexed and thus are available to the system along with other data.
- A user-editable profile.
